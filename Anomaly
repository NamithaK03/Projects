Abstract
 Rapid advance of location acquisition technologies boosts the generation of trajectory data,
which track the traces of moving objects. A trajectory is typically represented by a sequence of
spatio-temporal locations. Trajectories of moving objects provide crucial clues for video event
analysis especially in surveillance applications. Timely detection of traffic violations and
abnormal behavior of vehicles at public places through computer vision and visual
surveillance can be highly effective for maintaining traffic order in cities. Anomaly detection
frameworks typically use supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised learning.
In this work, we propose a hybrid clustering and entropy-based trajectory outlier detection model
to learn normal behaviors in vehicle traffic using trajectory analysis and consequently to detect
abnormal behaviors. To estimate such a model, we aim to use object trajectories by utilizing
high-level interpretable features such as origin, destination, path, and deviation. Further, the
proposed features of speed, variance of the trajectory and deviation from the trajectory are
extracted as object-based features. Features such as location, velocity, and time appearance are
used to cluster trajectories. Clustering algorithm is used to detect abnormal sub-trajectories,
which identifies trajectory outliers with local features. On the other hand, by comparing the
velocity entropy of the trajectories, trajectory outliers are detected from the overall perspective.
The concept of trajectory confidence is proposed to evaluate the reliability of the results of
trajectory outlier detection, thereby further reducing the false detection rate and improving
accuracy.
