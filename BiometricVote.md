# Project Title: Biometric-Based Secure E-Voting System
## Abstract: 
The voting process is one of the significant issues in densely populated countries that is rarely given adequate consideration. This procedure is crucial in determining the country's position until the end of the current administration. Globally, the current electronic voting system poses questions about confidence, security, and transparency.  Through the creation of a fingerprint biometric authentication system for safe electronic voting machines, a system to address the existing issues has been developed. To authenticate votes, a fingerprint biometric sensor implemented using Arduino is used. The addition of biometrics enhances the system's security characteristics. In this proposed system we have used Arduino uno, Wi-Fi module which will be connected to the voters database and Fingerprint Scanner that can identify each voter, count votes and can avoid fake votes. Whenever a fake vote has been made, an alert message for the candidate has been sent to the registered mobile number of a voter. The proposed system is a highly secure, technology-based system.
